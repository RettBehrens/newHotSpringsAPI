I was inspired to build my own API after using the Star Wars API for a class project.

I'm working on building an API for hot springs that will serve up name, latitude, longitude, water temperature, nearest city, and state.

To play with this, fork and clone this repo, npm intall, launch the server on your local host and send requests via Postman.

The live/hosted version of this API will be read only but for now it's fully CRUDable.
